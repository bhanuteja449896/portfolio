                        A college security management system designed to streamline the student gate pass approval process. Students request permission from their department Head of Department (HOD) for leave, and the HOD verifies and approves the request. Upon approval, the system updates the database, granting authorized students the ability to exit the campus. Security personnel at the gate access real-time data to verify and confirm which students have permission to leave. The project improves campus security and simplifies the gate pass process by ensuring efficient communication between students, HOD, and security staff.
